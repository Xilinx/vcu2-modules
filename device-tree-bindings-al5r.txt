Allegro al5r video codec driver

Required Properties:
- compatible: "al,al5r"
- reg: Address range of the codec IP registers
- interrupt-parent: The phandle for the interrupt controller
- interrupts: Should contain interrupt for codec IP

Optional Properties:
al,devicename: specifies the /dev/X name the created device should have.
               default is that the /dev/X node isn't created.
- memory-region: a phandle that points to a reserved-memory node. The driver will
                 use the reserved memory instead of using the CMA pools to allocate
                 its memory.
al,regs_min_addr: specifies the offset at which the registers of the ip start
                  in the mapped region. The default is 0.
al,regs_min_addr_auto: Try to find what the offset of current IP is based on
                       the knowledge of some of the IP we support.

Example:

al5r@a3c80000 {
	compatible = "al,al5r";
	reg = <0x0 0xa3c80000 0x0 0x80000>;
	al,regs_min_addr = <0x8000>;
	interrupts = <0x0 0x59 0x4>;
	interrupt-parent = <0x4>;
	memory-region = <&reserved_dma>;
	al,devicename = "allegroIP";
};
