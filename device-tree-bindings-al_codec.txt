Allegro al_codec video codec driver

Required Properties:
- compatible: "al,ale2xx" or "al,ald3xx" respectively for encoder and decoder
- reg: Address range of the codec IP registers and address range where riscv
core will have it's internal apb bus mapped (See below)
- reg-names: must be "regs", "apb"
- interrupt-parent: The phandle for the interrupt controller
- interrupts: Should contain interrupt for codec IP

Optional Properties:
- al,devicename: specifies the /dev/X name the created device should have.
- memory-region: a phandle that points to a reserved-memory node. The driver will
                 use the reserved memory instead of using the CMA pools to allocate
                 its memory.
- clocks: Must contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
- clock-names: Should contain "mcu"; the mcu clock.

Riscv internal apb
riscv core has an internal apb bus that allow access to clint, plic and Ip
registers. Address of this apb in riscv physical memory space can be set using
index 1 of reg entry. Goal is to avoid clash with memory.
Size must be 64M bytes and address must be aligned on 64M bytes.

Example:

ald3xx@0x83c80000 {
	compatible = "al,ald3xx";
	reg = <0x83c80000 0x80000>, <0xc8000000 0x08000000>;
	reg-names = "regs", "apb";
	interrupt-parent = <0x3>;
	interrupts = <0x0 0x1d 0x4>;
	al,devicename="al_d3xx";
};

ale2xx@0x83c00000 {
	compatible = "al,ale2xx";
	reg = <0x83c00000 0x80000>, <0xc0000000 0x08000000>;
	reg-names = "regs", "apb";
	interrupt-parent = <0x3>;
	interrupts = <0x0 0x1d 0x4>;
	al,devicename="al_e2xx";
};
